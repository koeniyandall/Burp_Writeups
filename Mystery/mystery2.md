# Mystery 2

This mystery lab, I started as usual and found that when I tried to enumerate usernames from the app, the error message was only different for one of the usernames: info. This error message said "incorrect password" entailing that it was a valid username. So then all there was to do was brute force the password associated with this username and we ended up breaking into this users account!
