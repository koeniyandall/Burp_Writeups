# CLickjacking

Clickjacking is basically whenever you make an "invisible page" behind a legitimate page. This allows the attacker to kind of overlay and invisible button over a real button and perform arbitrary malicious actions against the user.This differs from something like CSRF because clickjacking relies on user input while something like CSRF only requires a session cookie or something of the likes.
